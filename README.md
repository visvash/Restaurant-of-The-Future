## The Waiter Robot
> Hello,
> I have Re-designed an improved version of the robotic waiter, capable of traversing in a restaurant <b>autonomously</b> with a 3WD.
> I applied a Lead-screw based mechanism to Al-extrusions to carry and transfer <b>payloads</b> up to 10kg to variable platforms.
> It has incorporated general curve navigation with the help of encoder coupled motor and PID controller for navigation.

# Electronics and control
## Process brief
<ol>
<li>Image Input from the overhead cameras on the restaurant are processed and path is planned using Image Processing and Dijkstra Algorithm.</li>
<li>Path send to Arduino using Wifi Module</li>
<li>Omni chasis based traversal on the given path of the bot to reach the desired table.</li>
<li>Chatbot starts interacting with the the customer and takes the order while recognising face and emotion of the customer.</li>
<li>After taking order, Bot traverses back to the initial position, waits for the order to be kept on its serving trays.</li>
<li>Bot traverses back to the customer on the same path and serves using a 3-tray serving mechanism</li>
</ol>

### Path Planning and Navigation
<ol>
<li><a href =" ">Image</a> is resized to (300 * 300) pixels (<a href = " ">sample resized</a>) and edge detection is deployed on grey image (<a href = " ">sample</a>).</li>
<li>Closed objects are assigned white pixel value. Fractal concept deployed for the same(<a href = " ">sample</a>).</li>
<li>Image is smoothened(<a href = " ">sample</a>).</li>
<li>Divided into a (n*n) grid with grid size (d*d), here n = 30, d= 10 (<a href = " ">sample Grids.txt</a>). </li>
<li>Each grid is declared as an obstacle(value =0) or a path(value =1) depending of the threshold value of the white pixel count.</li>
<li>Grid generated is written in a file and is the input to the shortest path planning - Dijkstra Algorithm(<a href = " ">src code</a>). Each unit of the grid in considered as the vertic and adajent vertics are analysed of each unit to generate a matrix of all vertices. </li>
<li>"Srcdest.txt" file stores the planned path in the form of vertices to traverse on(<a href = " ">sample</a>).</li>
<li>Path string, for instance R2F2B1L1, meaning to move 2 step to the right, 2 step forward, 1 step backward, 1 step Left, is generated by reading vertices.  </li>
<li>Path string is send using the urllib library of python on the url of the esp8266 Wifi module, obtained by connecting PC and Module on the same network.</li>
