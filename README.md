# Restaurant-of-The-Future

## The Waiter Robot
> Hello, 
> I have Re-designed an improved version of the robotic waiter, capable of traversing in a restaurant <b>autonomously</b> with a 3WD. 
> I applied a Lead-screw based mechanism to Al-extrusions to carry and transfer <b>payloads</b> up to 10kg to variable platforms.
> It has incorporated general curve navigation with the help of encoder coupled motor and PID controller for navigation.
